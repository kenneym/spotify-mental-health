# spotify-mental-health
*By Matt Kenney and Soo Hwan Park*

Final project for "Data Science for Health" course at Dartmouth. Our project analyzes the relationship between music-listening behavior in the United States and the mental health of the country. To study the relationship between the types of music individuals listen to at a given time and the state of their mental health, we analyze characteristics pertaining to music listening in the United States pulled from spotify data and model that data against Google Trends search term frequency for search terms related to mental health.
